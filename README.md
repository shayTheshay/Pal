## 

We utilized a web crawling technique using Python to extract information from the dog breed profiles on the https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/profiles website. The data was then stored in Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL database. In addition, we also gathered information about cats and stored it in an Express.js-based web server. The server was hosted on Render, a cloud platform for web applications, ensuring reliable and accessible storage of the data.
